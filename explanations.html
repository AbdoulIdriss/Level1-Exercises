        <p>
            I decided to design this page the way it is for the comfort of the users<br>
            which means atttention to the UI/UX desing
        </p>
        <p>
                Since Users don't mostly like complicated things, Putting the <span>Nav bar</span> aside facilitate
                the users to scroll all over without lossing the view of the navigation bar at the same time having the possibility to move from one page to anoter
        </p>
        <p>
                    Putting the <span>Research bar</span> up and the display result directly under permits the user to directly 
                        watch his results without any difficulty which is good for the User Experience

            
        </p>
        <p>
                Introducing the vocal possibility to research somethin improves the the User Experience.
            <br>
            In case of inability to write or simply bored to write this facilitates everything 
        </p>

            With the login/sign in by yhe end in case someone wants to create of login in their account
